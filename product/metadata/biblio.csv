"Benthic occurrences, habitat maps, and species traits","This data product links occurrences of benthic invertebrates from the EMODnet benthic numerical abundance product to two complementary seabed habitat products: the EMODnet broadscale habitat map 2019 (Vasquez et al., 2020), and Wilson et al.'s (2018) synthetic map of the north-west European Shelf sedimentary environment. We also process and incorporate qualitative information on the habitat and sediment preferences of species from the Biological Traits Information Catalogue BIOTIC database.", 2021-04-07,"Tom J.
