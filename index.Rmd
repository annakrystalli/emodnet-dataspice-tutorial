## Overview

The goal of this tutorial is to provide a **practical exercise in creating metadata** for an **example field collected data product** using package [`dataspice`](https://docs.ropensci.org/dataspice/). 

- Understand basic metadata and why it is important.

- Understand where and how to store them.

- Understand how they can feed into more complex metadata objects.


## Preliminaries

### Software Requirements

To follow this tutorial, you will need to have [**a recent version of R**](https://cran.r-project.org/) and ideally [**RStudio Desktop**](https://www.rstudio.com/download) installed.

You will also need to install package  `dataspice` as well as a few additional helper packages.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("dataspice"))
```

### Tutorial Materials

You will also need to fork (make a copy of) and clone (download your fork) the example Data Product [**EMODnet/EMODnet-Biology-Benthic-Habitats-Occurrences-Traits**](https://github.com/EMODnet/EMODnet-Biology-Benthic-Habitats-Occurrences-Traits) I will be working with in this tutorial.
